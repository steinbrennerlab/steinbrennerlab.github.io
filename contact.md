<h2>Opportunities to join the lab</h2>

Open positions will be shared on the news page. Other opportunities to join the lab are described below:

<h3>Postdoctoral Researchers:</h3>
The lab is eager to facilitate postdoctoral projects related to our research interests. Opportunities from current grants are listed on the <a href="http://steinbrennerlab.org">home page</a>. If you are interested to seek external postdoctoral funding to join the lab, please reach out to Adam 4-12 months in advance of application deadlines. Please email Prof. Steinbrenner with a description of your previous research and future goals. <br>

Funding opportunities include:<br>
• <a href="https://www.wrfseattle.org/grants/wrf-postdoctoral-fellowships/">WRF Postdoctoral Program</a> (due June)<br>
• <a href="https://nifa.usda.gov/grants/funding-opportunities/agriculture-food-research-initiative-education-workforce-development">USDA NIFA Postdoctoral Fellowships Program</a> (due mid-summer)<br>

<h3>Graduate Students:</h3>
The lab accepts students through the <a href="https://www.biology.washington.edu/programs/graduate/admissions">UW Biology PhD program</a> and the <a href="https://mcb-seattle.edu/">Seattle MCB program</a>. Please reach out to Prof. Steinbrenner  in late summer or early fall in advance of November application deadlines. Your email should include a CV and brief cover letter describing your goals for graduate study.

If you are considering graduate study in my lab or others, I highly encourage you to check eligibility and apply for the <a href="https://www.nsfgrfp.org/">NSF GRFP</a>. I am happy to provide feedback on GRFP applications provided well in advance of a deadline. Applications prior to admittance to a graduate program are encouraged by NSF, and are not disadvantaged relative to those from current graduate students. Generally, applicants are allowed to re-apply upon joining a graduate program.

Other potential sources of graduate funding, especially for those not eligible for NSF funding, include:<br>
• <a href="https://us.fulbrightonline.org/">Fulbright Program</a><br>
• <a href="https://www.hertzfoundation.org/the-fellowship/apply-for-fellowship/">Hertz Felloship</a><br>
