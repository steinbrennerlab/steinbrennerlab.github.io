Please email Prof. Steinbrenner with a description of your previous research and future goals. Funding opportunities include the <a href="https://nifa.usda.gov/grants/funding-opportunities/agriculture-food-research-initiative-education-workforce-development">USDA NIFA Postdoctoral Fellowships Program</a> (due mid-summer) and <a href="https://beta.nsf.gov/funding/opportunities/postdoctoral-research-fellowships-biology-prfb">NSF Postdoctoral Research Fellowships</a> (due fall), <a href="https://www.wrfseattle.org/grants/wrf-postdoctoral-fellowships/">WRF Postdoctoral Program</a> (due June) and <a href="https://lsrf.org/">LSRF Postdoctoral Fellowships</a><br>

<h3>Graduate Students:</h3>
The lab accepts students through the UW Biology PhD program. Please reach out in late summer and early fall in advance of November application deadlines. Please email Prof. Steinbrenner with a brief cover letter describing your goals for graduate study.

If you are considering graduate study in my lab or others, I highly encourage you to apply for the <a href="https://www.nsfgrfp.org/">NSF GRFP</a>. I am happy to provide feedback on GRFP applications provided well in advance of a deadline. Applications prior to admittance to a graduate program are encouraged and are not disadvantaged relative to those from current graduate students. You may re-apply in graduate school.

<h3>Undergraduate Students:</h3>
The lab welcomes enthusiastic UW undergraduates in any major. Students can receive BIOL499: Independent Research credit. Paid research opportunities may be available if there is a demonstrated need. Eligible students for Federal Work Study are especially encouraged to apply.
