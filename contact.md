<h2>Opportunities to join the lab</h2>

Open positions will be shared on the news page. Other opportunities to join the lab are described below:

<h3>Undergraduate Students:</h3>
The lab welcomes inquiries from enthusiastic UW undergraduates as early as 1st year and in any STEM major, including major-undeclared students. Students can receive BIOL499: Independent Research credit. Paid research opportunities are available with priority given to Federal Work Study eligible students. Look for our job ad in the <a href="https://apps.osfa.washington.edu/workstudy/pages/jobs.php?onCampus">work study</a> database under Organization Name: Biology.

Please email Prof. Steinbrenner with a resumé and brief description of your interests, any previous experience, and relevant coursework.

<h3>Postbacs / Technicians:</h3>
The lab always accepts applications for enthusiastic early-career scientists seeking 1-2 years of research experience prior to admission to graduate programs. Previous experience in plant care, molecular biology, and/or genomics is required. Technicians are given mentorship and support through a network of plant molecular biologists in the UW Biology department, including the opportunity to present in weekly joint lab meetings. The lab has a strong track record supporting technicians to apply to fellowships and graduate programs while employed: see <a href="http://steinbrennerlab.org/mentorship">mentorship page page</a> for additional details.

Please email Prof. Steinbrenner with a CV describing your goals for graduate study and previous research experience.

<h3>Graduate Students:</h3>
The lab accepts students through the <a href="https://www.biology.washington.edu/programs/graduate/admissions">UW Biology PhD program</a> and the <a href="https://mcb-seattle.edu/">Seattle MCB program</a>. Please reach out to Prof. Steinbrenner  in late summer or early fall in advance of November application deadlines. Your email should include a CV and brief cover letter describing your goals for graduate study.

If you are considering graduate study in my lab or others, I highly encourage you to check eligibility and apply for the <a href="https://www.nsfgrfp.org/">NSF GRFP</a>. I am happy to provide feedback on GRFP applications provided well in advance of a deadline. Applications prior to admittance to a graduate program are encouraged by NSF, and are not disadvantaged relative to those from current graduate students. Generally, applicants are allowed to re-apply upon joining a graduate program.

Other potential sources of graduate funding, especially for those not eligible for NSF funding, include:<br>

<h3>Postdoctoral Researchers:</h3>
The lab is eager to facilitate postdoctoral projects related to our research interests. Opportunities from current grants are listed on the <a href="http://steinbrennerlab.org">home page</a>. If you are interested to seek external postdoctoral funding to join the lab, please reach out to Adam 4-12 months in advance of application deadlines.
