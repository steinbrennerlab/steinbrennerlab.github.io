## CSF Project: "Revealing the heritage and evolution of UW Yoshino Cherries through whole genome sequencing"

We recently received funding from the UW Campus Sustainability Fund to sequence the genomes of the famous quad cherry trees

We will work with Dr. Alex Harkess of the <a href="https://actg-wgaa.readthedocs.io/en/latest/
">American Campus Tree Genomes</a> project

We plan to sequence the genomes of our iconic Yoshino cherry trees on the Quad. By analyzing the genetic information we will be able to trace the trees back to original clonal varieties from Japan, and we will generate flyers and a presentation about the heritage and conservation of the cherries in the future. The findings will promote campus community around the cherry blossom season, will contribute to a broader nationwide project to sequence American Campus Tree Genomes (ACTG), and will train undergraduate student interns in modern genomic techniques through the Steinbrenner lab in UW Biology (www.steinbrennerlab.org). In addition to Professor Steinbrennerâ€™s laboratory, the project will involve the Campus arborist, visitor center, volunteers with the Brockman Campus Tree Tour, and the HudsonAlpha Institute for Biotechnology. More information can be found on the <a href="https://csf.uw.edu/project/1176">CSF webpage</a>.

We are recruiting students to help with genome analyses in Spring and Summer 2025. Interested students can learn more about plant genomic analyses in the winter 2025 course, BIOL426 Comparative Immunology. Please reach out to Dr. Steinbrenner with any questions.
