Ava is an undergraduate studying Plant Biology at UW. She joined the Steinbrenner lab in October 2019 and is excited to learn more about working with plants in a lab setting. Her favorite place in Seattle is the Volunteer Park Conservatory and she would spend all her time in a greenhouse if given the opportunity.
