The core of Adam's postdoctoral work is now posted on bioRxiv (https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/679803v1) in a manuscript entitled "A Receptor for Herbivore-Associated Molecular Patterns Mediates Plant Immunity."  We are excited to connect surface immune recognition to chewing herbivory through INR.  We're very happy it's available on bioRxiv as it works its way through journal submission.  Comments are welcome, please email or Twitter DM @ADSteinbrenner.
