Adam will attend the 10th Conference of the Asia-Pacific Association of Chemical Ecologists and will present in Session 3: "Signaling and Perception in Plant-Herbivore Interactions."  Say hello if you are also attending, and come to hear about INR and our future plans to understand evolution of immune recognition across bean populations.
