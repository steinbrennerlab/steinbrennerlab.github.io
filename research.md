### Pest recognition and differentiation by plant immunity

<img src="/images/research1.png" class="align-left" alt="">
Plants detect pest-associated molecular patterns through surface immune receptors, which bind extracellular ligands and initiate defense signal transduction.  Many well-characterized receptors detect pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) such as flg22, but receptors for other pest classes such as chewing herbivores are not well understood.  How do plants initiate differential signal transduction downstream of receptors for herbivores and pathogens, potentially upstream of hormonal antagonisms?

### â€‹Herbivore resistance in legumes
<img src="/images/research2.jpg" class="align-left" alt="">
Species in the the legume family (Fabaceae) are uniquely able to respond to inceptin, a family of small peptides present in all studied Lepidopteran larval oral secretions.  How do inceptin responses vary across populations and species?  Does this matter for resistance and tolerance to herbivores in nature?

### Evolution of immune receptor function

Only a subset of surface receptors have immune functions; others serve critical roles in growth and development.  How do new immune functions emerge from ancestral roles for receptors?  Can we identify immune receptors from genome sequence data?
