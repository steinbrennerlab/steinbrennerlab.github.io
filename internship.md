Apply for a 10-week summer research experience in Seattle, WA</h3>

The University of Washington Department of Biology is seeking a 10-week summer research intern to work on the molecular basis for plant-herbivore interactions.

The summer student will gain hands-on experience with molecular biology, genetics, and chemical ecology of plants. Projects will focus on plant immune receptors which detect caterpillar signals. The student will work closely with graduate students and other summer undergraduates in the Steinbrenner lab at UW, located in the Life Sciences Building.

Summer stipend and housing allowance is available to support the intern. We aim to train a beginning undergraduate student with a passion for plants. Students with no prior research experience are encouraged to apply.

Please email resume / CV to Prof. Adam Steinbrenner. A brief note (3-4 sentences) explaining why you are interested in plant biology research is also helpful. Successful applicants may be contacted for a brief Zoom interview. Decisions will be made by March 30, 2023.
