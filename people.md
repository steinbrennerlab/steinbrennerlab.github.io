<strong>
Natalia Guayazan-Palacios <br>
Graduate Student <br> 
nguaya /at/ uw.edu <br>
</strong>
My MS research was focused on cell and transcriptional changes that plant pathogens undergo during host colonization, and population genetics and phenotype-genotype associations in plant pathogens. My model organisms were Phytophthora infestans (Irish famine pathogen) and Phytophthora betacei causing late blight on potato and tree tomato crops in South America, respectively. In the Steinbrenner Lab, I have expanded my interests to plant immune responses to biotic stressors. Using cowpea as a model, I aim to understand herbivore specific-immune responses and the role of the circadian clock in their strength and timing. Outside of the lab I enjoy baking, running, and learning other languages.  Twitter: @nataliagupa.

Brian Behnken. Brian is a microbiology major with the intention of pursuing a PhD in immunology. He joined the lab in winter of 2022 and is looking forward to learning about plant immune systems. His interests include research and reading anything from physics to biology, and outside of the academy he enjoys backpacking, finding any excuse to make curry, and create art.

Hannah Luskin. Hannah is a Molecular, Cellular and Developmental Biology major who joined the lab in September 2021. She enjoys learning about genetic engineering in plants especially as it relates to plant defenses or drought resistance. Outside of school, she enjoys nature photography, swimming, kayaking, and gardening.
