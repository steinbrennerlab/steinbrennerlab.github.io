<strong>
Kelsey Wood <br>
Postdoctoral Researcher <br>
klsywd /at/ uw.edu <br>
</strong>
PhD in Genomics from UC Davis, previously studied plant pathogens. Currently working on caterpillar genomics and plant-insect interactions. Passionate about science communication, outreach, teaching. Outside of science, I enjoy art, music, my cat, cooking, and travel.

<strong>
Di Wu <br>
Postdoctoral Researcher <br>
woody63 /at/ uw.edu <br>
</strong>
Di joined the lab in November 2023 as a postdoctoral researcher, bringing a diverse background in plant immune signaling and plant-herbivore interactions. Currently, he is investigating the spatial aspects of INR-mediated defense, along with screening for additional components in the INR-mediated pathways.

<strong>
Brian Behnken <br>
Research Technician <br>
bbehnken /at/ uw.edu <br>
</strong>
Brian is a microbiology major with the intention of pursuing a PhD in immunology. He joined the lab in winter of 2022 and is looking forward to learning about plant immune systems. His interests include research and reading anything from physics to biology, and outside of the academy he enjoys backpacking, finding any excuse to make curry, and create art.

Ben Sheppard <br> 
Graduate Student <br>
bdshep /at/ uw.edu <br>
</strong>
I am graduate student studying molecular mechanisms of immune signaling in plants. Previously I studied plant genetics as an undergraduate at Whitman College, and worked in human vaccine research at Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center. My key interest is in understanding how the molecular perception of pathogens and pests induces threat-specific immune responses in plants. My current work focuses on the role of signaling kinases following plant perception of caterpillar herbivory by the legume Inception Receptor.

<strong>
Natalia Guayazan-Palacios <br>
Graduate Student <br> 
nguaya /at/ uw.edu <br>
</strong>
I am a USDA-NIFA predoctoral fellow studying the molecular mechanisms that regulate plant-induced defenses. During my BSc and MSc, I focused on plant pathogens and the cellular and transcriptomic changes they undergo during plant host colonization. Although a microbiologist at heart, I always wondered “How do plants fend off invaders?” as I saw my favorite plant pathogen struggle to colonize a new host. This question stayed with me, ultimately leading me to the Steinbrenner lab where I currently explore the regulation of herbivore- and pathogen-induced defenses in legumes through an approach that integrates transcriptomics, molecular biology, biochemistry, and bioassays with herbivores and microbes.

<strong>
Adam Steinbrenner <br>
Principal Investigator <br>
astein10 /at/ uw.edu <br>
</strong>
Associate Professor, UW Dept. of Biology<br>
HHMI Postdoctoral Fellow, UC San Diego (2016-2019)<br>
PhD 2015, UC Berkeley Dept. of Plant & Microbial Biology<br>
BS 2010, Tufts University<br><br>
I am fascinated by plant immune systems. Building on my training in chemical ecology and molecular genetics of immune receptors, my lab now explores new aspects of plant immunity, often using comparative, evolutionary, and synthetic biology lenses. I love working with excited, creative trainees to develop projects on these topics.
