<strong>
Di Wu <br>
Postdoctoral Researcher <br>
woody63 /at/ uw.edu <br>
</strong>
Di joined the lab in November 2023 as a postdoctoral researcher, bringing a diverse background in plant immune signaling and plant-herbivore interactions. Currently, he is investigating the spatial aspects of INR-mediated defense, along with screening for additional components in the INR-mediated pathways.

Brian Behnken <br>
Research Technician <br>
bbehnken /at/ uw.edu <br>
</strong>
Brian is a microbiology major with the intention of pursuing a PhD in immunology. He joined the lab in winter of 2022 and is looking forward to learning about plant immune systems. His interests include research and reading anything from physics to biology, and outside of the academy he enjoys backpacking, finding any excuse to make curry, and create art.

Natalia Guayazan-Palacios <br>
Graduate Student <br> 
nguaya /at/ uw.edu <br>
</strong>
My MS research was focused on cell and transcriptional changes that plant pathogens undergo during host colonization, and population genetics and phenotype-genotype associations in plant pathogens. My model organisms were Phytophthora infestans (Irish famine pathogen) and Phytophthora betacei causing late blight on potato and tree tomato crops in South America, respectively. In the Steinbrenner Lab, I have expanded my interests to plant immune responses to biotic stressors. Using cowpea as a model, I aim to understand herbivore specific-immune responses and the role of the circadian clock in their strength and timing. Outside of the lab I enjoy baking, running, and learning other languages.  Twitter: @nataliagupa.

<strong>
Adam Steinbrenner <br>
Principal Investigator <br>
astein10 /at/ uw.edu <br>
</strong>
Assistant Professor, UW Dept. of Biology (2019-present)<br>
HHMI Postdoctoral Fellow, UC San Diego (2016-2019)<br>
PhD 2015, UC Berkeley Dept. of Plant & Microbial Biology<br><br>
BS 2010, Tufts University<br><br>
I am fascinated by plant immune systems. Building on my training in chemical ecology and molecular genetics of immune receptors, my lab now explores new aspects of plant immunity, often using comparative, evolutionary, and synthetic biology lenses. I love working with excited, creative trainees to develop, execute, and publish novel projects on these topics.

Morgan Alonso. I'm a junior majoring in molecular, cellular, and developmental biology and minoring in bioethics. Outside of the lab, I enjoy teaching science lessons to elementary schoolers through Science Explorers and playing on the UW lacrosse team.
