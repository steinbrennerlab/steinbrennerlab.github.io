<strong>
Anthony Garcia <br>
Rotation Student <br>
agg13 /at/ uw.edu <br>
</strong>
Anthony loves learning about plant physiology, especially how plants respond to herbivores and pathogens, and also enjoys running, finding interesting music, and eating Polish and Mexican food.

<strong>
Natalia Guayazan-Palacios <br>
Graduate Student <br> 
nguaya /at/ uw.edu <br>
</strong>
My MS research was focused on cell and transcriptional changes that plant pathogens undergo during host colonization, and population genetics and phenotype-genotype associations in plant pathogens. My model organisms were Phytophthora infestans (Irish famine pathogen) and Phytophthora betacei causing late blight on potato and tree tomato crops in South America, respectively. In the Steinbrenner Lab, I have expanded my interests to plant immune responses to biotic stressors. Using cowpea as a model, I aim to understand herbivore specific-immune responses and the role of the circadian clock in their strength and timing. Outside of the lab I enjoy baking, running, and learning other languages.  Twitter: @nataliagupa.

<strong>
Simon Snoeck <br>
Postdoctoral Researcher <br>
spsnoeck /at/ uw.edu <br>
</strong>
My PhD research focused on genetic and molecular mechanisms of pesticide resistance and long-term host plant acclimation of the generalist herbivore Tetranychus urticae. Throughout my studies, my interests gradually evolved and extended beyond arthropods. I am particularly interested in broad questions at the intersection of herbivores and host plants, and how these interactions transcend multiple scales of biology: molecular, cellular and ecological. As a boyscout, I love spending time outdoors while performing physical activities. Occasionally, I participate in triathlon competitions.

Brian Behnken. Brian is a microbiology major with the intention of pursuing a PhD in immunology. He joined the lab in winter of 2022 and is looking forward to learning about plant immune systems. His interests include research and reading anything from physics to biology, and outside of the academy he enjoys backpacking, finding any excuse to make curry, and create art.

Hannah Luskin. Hannah is a Molecular, Cellular and Developmental Biology major who joined the lab in September 2021. She enjoys learning about genetic engineering in plants especially as it relates to plant defenses or drought resistance. Outside of school, she enjoys nature photography, swimming, kayaking, and gardening.
