## Projects

I am fascinated by the plant immune system and its unique challenges.  Plants face would-be parasitism from arthropods, bacteria, viruses, fungi/oomycetes, nematodes etc, but the vast majority of interactions instead lead to a successful immune response.  My lab group seeks to understand how diverse immune systems monitor and balance defense responses to threats.

In free time I'm a runner, hiker, baseball fan, and amateur home cook
