## Projects

I am fascinated by the plant immune system and its unique challenges.  Plants face would-be parasitism from arthropods, bacteria, viruses, fungi/oomycetes, nematodes etc, but the vast majority of interactions instead lead to a successful immune response (avirulence).  Receptors are germline encoded and form a finite repertoire; how do plants recognize a limitless variety of threats?  Specialized defense responses can be mutually antagonistic; how does resistance activate against to different pest classes (e.g. chewing herbivory/necrotrophy vs piercing herbivory/biotrophy).  Receptors and their concordant responses are often limited to certain plant clades; how do these new recognition capacities evolve?
