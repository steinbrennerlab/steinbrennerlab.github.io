## Experience
BS, MS and Doctor of Bioscience Engineering, Ghent university

## Interests
My PhD research focused on genetic and molecular mechanisms of pesticide resistance and long-term host plant acclimation of the generalist herbivore Tetranychus urticae. Throughout my studies, my interests gradually evolved and extended beyond arthropods. I am particularly interested in broad questions at the intersection of herbivores and host plants, and how these interactions transcend multiple scales of biology: molecular, cellular and ecological.
As a boyscout, I love spending time outdoors while performing physical activities. Occasionally, I participate in triathlon competitions.
