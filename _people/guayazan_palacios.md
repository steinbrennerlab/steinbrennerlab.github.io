Natalia joined the UW Department of Biology in September 2019.

## Experience
BS Microbiology, MS Biological Sciences, MS Computational Biology. Universidad de Los Andes. Bogotá, Colombia

## Interests
My MS research was focused on cell and transcriptional changes that plant pathogens undergo during host colonization, and population genetics and phenotype-genotype associations in plant pathogens. My model organisms were Phytophthora infestans (Irish famine pathogen) and Phytophthora betacei causing late blight on potato and tree tomato crops in South America, respectively. In the Steinbrenner Lab, I have expanded my interests to plant immune responses to biotic stressors. Using cowpea as a model, I aim to understand herbivore specific-immune responses and the role of the circadian clock in their strength and timing. 
Outside of the lab I enjoy baking, running, and learning other languages.
