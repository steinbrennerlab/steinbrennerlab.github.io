## Steinbrenner Lab Mentorship Policies

Our goal is to understand plant immunity through reading, discussion, and experimentation, and then share insights with the world. As a Principal Investigator I hope to mentor the next generation of plant biologists. I aim to excite and challenge mentees and to build curiosity, skill, and independence. I work to maintain an environment where trainees can build these foundations in a safe and welcoming space. Lab members will have opportunities to network with other plant biology labs in UW Biology and around campus.

I work hard to set expectations and goals with all permanent (non-undergraduate) lab members. We use three mechanisms beyond regular meetings:
1. A Mentorship Compact based on UW Biology's <a href="https://www.biology.washington.edu/sites/default/files/general/Biology_MentorshipCompactChecklist_2021-04-28.docx">guidelines</a> to set logistical and mentorship expectations.
2. Individual Development Plan (IDP) completed within three months of joining the lab permanently.  The IDP is meant to set personal and professional goals, determine if you have sufficient resources, and discuss other possible mentors or training.  The mentee is expected to revise the IDP at least yearly.  We will set aside an hour to revise at least once a year.
  <a href="http://depts.washington.edu/mbtguw/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/IDP.docx">This</a> is an example format.
3. Quarterly IDP check-ins – at the end of each quarter, we will structure our one-on-one meeting to discuss progress toward year goals and if any resources or changes would help to meet goals.
