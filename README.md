# steinbrennerlab.github.io
The Steinbrenner lab webpage uses So Simple, a Jekyll theme https://github.com/mmistakes/so-simple-theme/tree/master/docs.  It is hosted by Github pages.  

Most pages are static html.  Content is added to the "News" or "People" pages by creating .md files within the posts and people subfolders, respectively, then rebuilding the webpage in jackyll 
```bundle exec jekyll b```
and pushing edits to github.  

# Adding news
Send a snippet of text with date, or even better a .md file modeled after one in the "_posts" subfolder.  It will be added to _posts

# Adding yourself
Send a thumbnail (aim for 400 px wide, 200 px tall), a larger image, and any information (minimum: one-sentence summary of interests)
